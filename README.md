# Module-5-Python-Examples

Hello my name is Victor, I am the author of these programs. There are six Python code programs within this repository. To use each of the programs paste the program's code into a text editor with Python support, run the program, and follow any on screen instructions and the results will be provided.

The first program prints "Hello World" 100 times.

The second program prints the list of numbers: 12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20. 

The third program prints the list of numbers: 12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20 and each of their squares.

The fourth program asks the user for the number of sides, the length of the side, the color of the line, and the fill color of a regular polygon then draws it. 

The fifth program prints numbers 1-50, and determines if each number is divisible by 3, 5, or both. 

The sixth program draws a blue square inside of a red square. The red square is at a 45 degree angle.
